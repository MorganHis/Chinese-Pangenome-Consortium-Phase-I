## Step-by-step method details

### HiFi reads generation

Totally 68 samples were sequenced on 2â€“5 single 8M SMRT Cells. The obtained subreads are converted into HiFi reads by the ccs-v6.3.0 in PacBio tools with `--hifi-kinetics` `--min-passes 3` `--min-length 50`.

```shell

```

Convert `*.ccs.bam` to `*.ccs.fastq.gz`

```shell

```

Merge HiFi reads from multiple SMRT Cells.

```shell

```
